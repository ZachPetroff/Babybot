# Mobile Dynamics
  The intuition behind this approach is that there are certain times during the connected phase when there is
  no additional reward for moving the connected limb; rather, there is a cost. The contingent reward for the connected
  limb is given once the mobile begins to move. However, the mobile continues to swing some time after the connected limb 
  moves. During this phase, moving the connected arm would provide no additional reward. If we assume that the infant, 
  in a sense, wants to be as "efficient" as possible, then movement during this window of time should be disencouraged.
